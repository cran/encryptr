Description: It is important to ensure that sensitive data is protected. 
    This straightforward package is aimed at the end-user. 
    Strong RSA encryption using a public/private key pair is used to encrypt data frame or tibble columns.
    A public key can be shared to allow others to encrypt data to be sent to you. 
    This is particularly aimed a healthcare settings so patient data can be pseudonymised.
